# NYCDA Lesson 3 - CSS Layouts and GitHub
A project that I created during my New York Code + Design Academy Web Dev 100 class in Philly. This project was to create a static newspaper website.

Assignment:<br>
Create a fake website for a newspaper, "The New York Code + Design Academy Times"

There should be two pages:

* Home page, where 4 fake articles are listed in a two-column layout -- they should all link to:

  * An example article with a link to Facebook that stays on the page no matter how much the page is scrolled

  * The example article should have a photo with text that wraps around the photo
